([Learning Python, 5th edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do), Mark Lutz).

    "\n",
    "You're getting very good at using lambda functions! Here's one more function to add to your repertoire of skills. The `reduce()` function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike `map()` and `filter()`, returns a single value as a result. To use `reduce()`, you must import it from the `functools` module.\n",

    "- In the `reduce()` call, pass a lambda function that takes two string arguments `item1` and `item2` and concatenates them; also pass the list of strings, `stark`. Assign the result to `result`. The first argument to `reduce()` should be the lambda function and the second argument is the list `stark`."
