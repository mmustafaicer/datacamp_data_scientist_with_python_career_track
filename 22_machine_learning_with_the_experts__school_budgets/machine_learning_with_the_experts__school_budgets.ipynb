    "### Encode the labels as categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, your ultimate goal is to predict the probability that a certain label is attached to a budget line item. You just saw that many columns in your data are the inefficient `object type`. Does this include the labels you're trying to predict? Let's find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 9 columns of labels in the dataset. Each of these columns is a category that has [many possible values it can take](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/4/box-plots-for-education/page/15/#labels_list). The 9 labels have been loaded into a list called `LABELS`. In the Shell, check out the type for these labels using `df[LABELS].dtypes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that every label is encoded as an object datatype. Because `category` datatypes are [much more efficient](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2015/06/18/Categoricals) your task is to convert the labels to category types using the `.astype()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `.astype()` only works on a pandas Series. Since you are working with a pandas DataFrame, you'll need to use the `.apply()` method and provide a `lambda` function called `categorize_label` that applies `.astype()` to each column, `x`.\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the lambda function `categorize_label` to convert column `x` into `x.astype('category')`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the video, Peter explained that a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing#Feature_vectorization_using_the_hashing_trick) function takes an input, in your case a token, and outputs a hash value. For example, the input may be a string and the hash value may be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've loaded a familiar python datatype, a dictionary called `hash_dict`, that makes this mapping concept a bit more explicit. In fact, [python dictionaries ARE hash tables](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/114830/is-a-python-dictionary-an-example-of-a-hash-table)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Print `hash_dict` in the IPython Shell to get a sense of how strings can be mapped to integers.\n",
