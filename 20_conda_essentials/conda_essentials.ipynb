    "### What are packages and why are they needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda packages are files containing a bundle of resources: usually libraries and executables, but not always. In principle, Conda packages can include data, images, notebooks, or other assets. The command-line tool `conda` is used to install, remove and examine packages; other tools such as the GUI *Anaconda Navigator* also expose the same capabilities. This course focuses on the `conda` tool itself (you'll see use cases other than package management in later chapters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda packages are most widely used with Python, but that's not all. Nothing about the Conda package format or the `conda` tool itself assumes any specific programming language. Conda packages can also be used for bundling libraries in other languages (like R, Scala, Julia, etc.) or simply for distributing pure binary executables generated from *any* programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the powerful aspects of `conda`—both the tool and the package format—is that dependencies are taken care of. That is, when you install any Conda package, any other packages needed get installed automatically. Tracking and determining software dependencies is a hard problem that package managers like Conda are designed to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Conda package, then, is a file containing all files needed to make a given program execute correctly on a given system. Moreover, a Conda package can contain binary artifacts specific to a particular platform or operating system. Most packages (and their dependencies) are available for Windows (`win-32` or `win-64`), for OSX (`osx-64`), and for Linux (`linux-32` or `linux-64`). A small number of Conda packages are available for more specialized platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi 2 or POWER8 LE). As a user, you do not need to specify the platform since Conda will simply choose the Conda package appropriate for the platform you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "What feature is **NOT** true of Conda packages?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Conda package format is programming-language and asset-type independent.\n",
    "- **Each package contains binary artifacts (executables) for all supported platforms**.\n",
    "- Packages contain a description of all dependencies, all of which are installed together.\n",
    "- The tool `conda` can be used to install, examine, or remove packages from a working system.\n",
    "- Other GUI or web-based tools can be used as a wrapper for the tool `conda` for package management."

    "\n",
    "Installing a package is largely a matter of listing the name(s) of packages to install after the command `conda install`. But there is more to it behind the scenes. The versions of packages to install (along with all their dependencies) must be compatible with all versions of other software currently installed. Often this \"satisfiability\" constraint depends on choosing a package version compatible with a particular version of Python that is installed. Conda is special among \"package managers\" in that it always guarantees this consistency; you will see the phrase \"Solving environment...\" during installation to indicate this computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may simply instruct `conda` to install `foo-lib`. The tool first determines which operating system you are running, and then narrows the match to candidates made for this platform. Then, `conda` determines the version of Python on the system (say 3.7), and chooses the package version for `-py37`. But, beyond those simple limits, all dependencies are checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose `foo-lib` is available in versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.0, 3.1 (for your platform and Python version). As a first goal, `conda` attempts to choose the latest version of `foo-lib`. However, maybe `foo-lib` depends on `bar-lib`, which itself is available in various versions (say 1 through 20 in its versioning scheme). It might be that `foo-lib` 3.1 is compatible with `bar-lib` versions 17, 18, and 19; but `blob-lib` (which is already installed) is compatible only with versions of `bar-lib` less than 17. Therefore, `conda` would examine the compatibility of `foo-lib` 3.0 as a fallback. In this hypothetical, `foo-lib` 3.0 is compatible with `bar-lib` 16, so that version is chosen (`bar-lib` is also updated to the latest compatible version 16 in the same command if an earlier version is currently installed).\n",

    "### What is semantic versioning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Conda packages use a system called [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to identify distinct versions of a software package unambiguously. Version labels are usually chosen by the project authors, not necessarily the same people who bundle the project as a Conda package. There is no technical requirement that a project author's version label coincides with a Conda package version label, but the convention of doing so is almost always followed. Semantic version labels can be compared lexicographically and make it easy to determine which of two versions is the later version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), software is labeled with a three-part version identifier of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; the label components are non-negative integers separated by periods. Assuming all software starts at version `0.0.0`, the `MAJOR` version number is increased when significant new functionality is introduced (often with corresponding API changes). Increases in the `MINOR` version number generally reflect improvements (e.g., new features) that avoid backward-incompatible API changes. For instance, adding an optional argument to a function API (in a way that allows old code to run unchanged) is a change worthy of increasing the `MINOR` version number. An increment to the `PATCH` version number is appropriate mostly for bug fixes that preserve the same `MAJOR` and `MINOR` revision numbers. Software patches do not typically introduce new features or change APIs at all (except sometimes to address security issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many command-line tools display their version identifier by running `tool --version`. This information can sometimes be displayed or documented in other ways. For example, suppose on some system, a certain version of Python is installed, and you inquire about it like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw in the last exercise that there are about 100,000 `linux-64` packages on `conda-forge`. Across all the channels there are about 50,000 packages, most of those for at least 3 of the 5 main platforms (`osx-64`, `linux-32`, `linux-64`, `win-32`, `win-64`; 32-bit support is of diminishing importance compared to 64-bit). There are around 2500 channels that have been active in the last 6 months; most are individual users, but a fair number belonging to projects or organizations. A majority of package names are published by more than one different channel; sometimes just as a copy, other times with a tweak or compiler optimization, or in a different version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of having channels is to be able to install packages from them. For this exercise, you will install a version of a package not available on the default channel. Adding a channel to install from simply requires using the same `--channel` or `-c` switch we have seen in other `conda` commands, but with the `conda install` command.\n",

    "### Environments and why are they needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda *environments* allow multiple incompatible versions of the same (software) package to coexist on your system. An *environment* is simply a file path containing a collection of mutually compatible packages. By isolating distinct versions of a given package (and their dependencies) in distinct environments, those versions are all available to work on particular projects or tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of reasons why it is best practice to use environments, whether as a data scientist, software developer, or domain specialist. Without the concept of environments, users essentially rely on and are restricted to whichever particular package versions are installed globally (or in their own user accounts) on a particular machine. Even when one user moves scripts between machines (or shares them with a colleague), the configuration is often inconsistent in ways that interfere with seamless functionality. Conda environments solve both these problems. You can easily maintain and switch between as many environments as you like, and each one has exactly the collection of packages that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may develop a project comprising scripts, notebooks, libraries, or other resources that depend on a particular collection of package versions. You later want to be able to switch flexibly to newer versions of those packages and to ensure the project continues to function properly before switching wholly. Or likewise, you may want to share code with colleagues who are required to use certain package versions. In this context, an environment is a way of documenting a known set of packages that correctly support your project.\n",

    "### Which environment am I using?\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `conda`, you are always in some environment, but it may be the default (called the `base` or `root` environment). Your current environment has a name and contains a collection of packages currently associated with that environment. There are a few ways to determine the current environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most obviously, at a terminal prompt, the name of the current environment is usually prepended to the rest of your prompt in parentheses. Alternatively, the subcommand `conda env list` displays a list of all environments on your current system; the currently activated one is marked with an asterisk in the middle column. The subcommands of `conda env` (sometimes with suitable switches) encompass most of your needs for working with environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of `conda env list` shows that each environment is associated with a *particular directory*. This is **not** the same as your *current working directory* for a given project; being \"in\" an environment is completely independent of the directory you are working in. Indeed, you often wish to preserve a certain Conda environment and edit resources across multiple project directories (all of which rely on the same environment). The environment directory displayed by `conda env list` is simply the top-level file path in which all resources associated with that environment are stored; you need never manipulate those environment directories directly (other than via the `conda` command); indeed, it is much safer to leave those directories alone!\n",

    "Simply *having* different environments is not of much use; you need to be able to *switch between environments*. Most typically this is done at the command line, using the `conda` command. With some other interfaces (like Anaconda Navigator or Jupyter with `nb_conda` installed), other techniques for selecting environment are available. But for this course, you will learn about command-line use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *activate* an environment, you simply use `conda activate ENVNAME`. To *deactivate* an environment, you use `conda deactivate`, which returns you to the root/base environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used `conda` outside this course, and prior to version 4.4, you may have seen a more platform specific style. On older versions, Windows users would type `activate ENVNAME` and `deactivate`, while Linux and OSX users would type `source activate ENVNAME` and `source deactivate`. The unified style across platforms is more friendly. Related to the change to `conda activate`, version 4.4 and above use a special environment called `base` that is equivalent to what was called `root` in older versions. However, in old versions of `conda` you would not typically see an environment listed on the terminal prompt when you were in the root environment.\n",

Often you are happy to have other dependencies in the manner `conda` decides is best.\n",
